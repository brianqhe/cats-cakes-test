            overload be sure to
            buy the Sugar Explosion Cake which will leave you buzzing from a natural sugar high. A cake for every animal
            on earth. We make cakes of any design, want a 3D life sized Optimus Prime cake? We got it. Need to make it
            up to your spouse for forgetting your anniversary (again)? We have you covered! Caking is our passion. So
            much so that we use caking as a verb. We hope it catches on. Our cakes are the best way to get BAKED! Need a
            cake for that special day? We got you Bro! Piece of cake ðŸ˜‰ Warm day? Going to the beach? Have some cake
            by the ocean! Cakes are what we are. Cakes are who we are. Cake: a bouquet of flour. We like big cakes and
            we cannot lie. </p>
